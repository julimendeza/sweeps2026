## Admin Guide

### Changing settings
Admin → Settings: entry fee, currency, admin password, Firebase URL, registration deadline, scoring points.

### Entering results
Admin → Results: enter group match scores (standings auto-calculate) and knockout advancing teams round by round.

### Managing participants
Admin → Participants: view all entries ranked by current score, delete participants.

### Access control (PIN)
Admin → Access:
- **Off** — open registration (default)
- **Simple** — participant enters a PIN you've issued, then fills their own name/email
- **Robust** — PIN is pre-linked to a name/email; details are pre-filled and locked

Generate PINs in the Access tab and share them with participants after they pay.

### Data backup
Admin → Data: download a JSON backup before any risky change, restore from backup, or push all local data to Firebase.

### Email notifications
Admin → Email: configure EmailJS (free tier) to send invitation and results update emails to all participants.
